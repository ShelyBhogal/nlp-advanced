    "# Text Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, the dataset contains documents of BBC News articles related to business, entertainment, politics, sports and technology. Each document is comprised of several paragraphs that are separated by newline character ('\\n'). Within each paragraph, you can have multiple sentences, which in turn have multiple words. You need to perform sentence-based tokenization and then vectorization on a text document before feeding it into a summarization function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** It is best to use TF-IDF vectorization and sort sentences by their scores indicating the most valuable sentences for summarizing.\n",
